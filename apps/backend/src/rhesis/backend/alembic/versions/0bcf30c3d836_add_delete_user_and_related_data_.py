    Create a PostgreSQL procedure to delete a user and their related data without deleting the organization.

    This procedure removes:
    - The user record itself
    - User's tokens
    - User's personal test runs

    But PRESERVES:
    - The organization structure
    - Organization-wide resources (projects, tests, etc.)
    - Resources created by the user (become "ghost" records)

    This is useful when you need to remove a specific user but keep the organization intact.

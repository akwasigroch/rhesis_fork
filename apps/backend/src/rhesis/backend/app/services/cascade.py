"""
Generic Cascade Service for Soft Delete and Restore Operations

This service provides automatic cascading of soft delete and restore operations
based on the configuration defined in config/cascade_config.py.

Key Features:
- Configuration-driven: No code changes needed for new cascades
- Efficient: Uses bulk UPDATE queries (no object fetching)
- Transactional: Operations are atomic within the calling transaction
- Organization-aware: Respects tenant isolation

Usage:
    # Automatically cascade based on configuration
    cascade_soft_delete(db, models.TestRun, test_run_id, org_id)
    cascade_restore(db, models.TestRun, test_run_id, org_id)

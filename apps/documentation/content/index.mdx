## Why Rhesis?

You spent weeks or months building something innovative. Don't let inadequate testing ruin the release. Traditional testing approaches fail with Gen AI because responses are non-deterministic, quality is subjective, and edge cases are infinite. Rhesis brings together technical and domain expertise to create testing that's as sophisticated as your Gen AI architecture.

## Built for Teams, know what you ship!

Advanced testing architecture, collaborative by design. Rhesis works with any Gen AI system and integrates seamlessly into your existing development workflow.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the cloud platform (fastest)

Get started in minutes at [app.rhesis.ai](https://app.rhesis.ai):

1. **Create a free account**
2. **Start generating test scenarios collaboratively**
3. **Invite your team to define requirements together**

### Option 2: Use the SDK

Install and configure the Python SDK:

```bash
pip install rhesis-sdk
```

```python
import rhesis

rhesis.api_key = "rh-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"  # Get from app.rhesis.ai settings
rhesis.base_url = "https://api.rhesis.ai"  # optional
```

**Quick example:**

```python
from rhesis.sdk.entities import TestSet
from rhesis.sdk.synthesizers import PromptSynthesizer

# Browse available test sets
for test_set in TestSet().all():
    print(test_set)

# Generate custom test scenarios
synthesizer = PromptSynthesizer(
    prompt="Generate tests for a medical chatbot that must never provide diagnosis"
)
test_set = synthesizer.generate(num_tests=100)
```

### Option 3: Run locally with Docker

Clone and run the full platform locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis.git
cd rhesis
docker-compose up
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access your local instance.

# Test Runs

Execute test sets against endpoints and analyze individual test results with detailed metrics and comparisons.

## Why Test Runs?

Understanding individual test executions is crucial for debugging and quality tracking. Test runs provide:

- **Detailed Analysis**: Drill into each test result with full prompts, responses, and metric breakdowns
- **Comparison**: Compare current results against baseline runs to detect regressions
- **Historical Tracking**: See how specific tests perform across multiple executions
- **Team Collaboration**: Assign runs for review, add comments, and track tasks
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Filter failed tests by behavior, search responses, and identify patterns

## Understanding Test Runs

A test run is the execution of a test set against a specific endpoint. When you run a test set, the platform creates a test run record that captures all the individual test results, execution metadata like start time and duration, the specific endpoint and test set combination used, and workflow information including assignee, owner, and tags.

## Viewing Test Runs

The Test Runs page provides both a detailed grid and analytical charts to help you understand your testing activity.

### Grid View

The grid shows each test run with its name and status, the test set and endpoint that were used, the pass rate and total number of tests executed, when it ran, who it's assigned to, and how many comments and tasks are associated with it. This gives you a comprehensive overview of all test executions at a glance.

### Charts

Below the grid, charts visualize your testing patterns. **Test Runs by Status** shows the distribution of run statuses, **Test Runs by Result** breaks down passed versus failed runs, **Most Run Test Sets** highlights your most frequently executed test sets, and **Top Test Executors** shows which team members are running the most tests.

## Test Run Detail Page

Click any test run to view detailed results.

### Summary Cards

At the top of the test run detail page, four summary cards provide key metrics: **Pass Rate** shows the percentage and count of passed tests, **Tests Executed** displays the total along with passed and failed counts, **Duration** shows how long the tests took to run and when they started, and **Status** indicates completion status with quick links to the associated test set and endpoint.

### Filtering and Search

Use the search bar to find specific test results by searching through prompt or response content. Status filter buttons let you quickly view all tests, only passed tests, or only failed tests. The behavior filter lets you focus on tests with specific behaviors, showing a count badge when filters are active. The results counter keeps you oriented by showing how many tests match your filters out of the total (for example, "45 of 120 tests").

### Test Results List

The left panel (approximately one-third of the screen width) shows a scrollable list of all test results in the run. Each result displays a pass/fail icon (green checkmark or red X), a truncated prompt preview (hover to see the full text), a metrics summary showing how many metrics passed (like "8/8 metrics"), and counts for any associated comments and tasks. The currently selected test is highlighted with a blue border.

**[SCREENSHOT HERE: Test run detail page showing the split panel layout. Left panel displays the scrollable test results list with pass/fail icons. Right panel shows the selected test's details with tabs (Overview, Metrics, History, Tasks & Comments). Highlight the summary cards at the top showing pass rate, tests executed, duration, and status.]**

Navigate through results by clicking on them, or use your keyboard's arrow up and down keys to move between tests. The list automatically scrolls to keep the selected test in view.

### Test Detail Panel

The right panel (approximately two-thirds of the screen width) shows detailed information for the selected test across multiple tabs.

#### Overview Tab

This tab displays the overall pass/fail status at the top, followed by two main sections. The **Prompt Section** shows the full prompt content in a scrollable box, while the **Response Section** displays the complete AI response. You can also add or edit tags for this test result to help with organization and searching.

#### Metrics Tab

The Metrics tab provides a detailed breakdown of how the test performed against each evaluation criterion. Summary cards at the top show overall performance along with the best and worst performing behaviors. Use the filter toggle to show all metrics, only passed metrics, or only failed metrics. The main metrics table lists each metric with its status, associated behavior, metric name, and the reason (explanation) for the score given.

#### History Tab

See how this specific test has performed across multiple test runs. The execution history shows the last 10 test runs where this exact test was executed, with links to view those runs in detail (opening in new tabs). The current run is highlighted for context, and summary statistics show the test's total executions, overall pass rate, and passed/failed counts across its history.

#### Tasks & Comments Tab

Use this tab to collaborate with your team about specific test results. Add tasks for follow-up actions, comment on issues or interesting observations, and track task status as issues are resolved.

## Comparing Test Runs

Click the "Compare" button to analyze how the current test run performs against a previous baseline execution. This is invaluable for regression testing and understanding how changes to your AI application affect test outcomes.

### Comparison Interface

Start by selecting a previous test run to use as your baseline. The comparison interface then provides several ways to filter and analyze the differences. You can view all tests, only improved tests (those that passed in the current run but failed in the baseline), only regressed tests (those that failed now but passed before), or unchanged tests (those with the same pass/fail status in both runs). The search box lets you filter the compared tests by prompt or response content.

### Comparison Statistics

At the top of the comparison view, summary statistics give you an immediate sense of the changes. Green numbers show how many tests improved, red numbers indicate regressions, and you'll see the count of tests that remained unchanged.

### Test-by-Test View

The main comparison area shows each test side-by-side. On the left is the baseline result with its status, metrics count, and score. On the right is the current result with the same information plus a trend indicator showing whether it improved or regressed. Click any test to open a detailed metric-level comparison that shows the prompts and responses for both runs, behavior metrics with score differences, individual metric status changes, and visual highlighting of improvements and regressions.

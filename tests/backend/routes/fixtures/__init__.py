"""
ðŸ§ª Fixtures Package for Route Testing

This package provides organized, domain-specific fixtures for route testing.
Fixtures are organized into logical packages for better maintainability.

Structure:
- entities/: Individual business entity fixtures organized by domain
  - dimensions.py, categories.py, topics.py, behaviors.py, endpoints.py, metrics.py
- relationships/: Complex fixtures with entity relationships
  - demographics.py, hierarchies.py, associations.py
- utilities/: Common test utilities and helpers
  - identifiers.py, generators.py, helpers.py
- mocks/: Service and external dependency mocks
  - services.py, external_apis.py, infrastructure.py

Usage:
    All fixtures are automatically imported via conftest.py
    and are available to all tests in the routes package.

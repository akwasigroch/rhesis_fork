# Knowledge

The Knowledge section provides documentation about Rhesis's core concepts and methodologies for AI testing and evaluation.

## What are Sources?

Sources are content that you add to Rhesis to provide context and domain knowledge for AI testing. They serve as the foundation for generating relevant, domain-specific test cases.

### Source Types

Rhesis currently supports:

- **Document**: Uploaded files (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text files, etc.)

<Callout type="info">
  **Future Support**: Additional source types including Website, API, Database, Code, and Manual are planned for future releases.
</Callout>

### Supported File Formats

When adding documents, Rhesis supports a wide range of file formats:

**Office Documents:**
- `.docx` - Microsoft Word documents
- `.pptx` - Microsoft PowerPoint presentations
- `.xlsx` - Microsoft Excel spreadsheets

**Documents:**
- `.pdf` - PDF files
- `.txt` - Plain text files
- `.csv` - Comma-separated values
- `.json` - JSON data files
- `.xml` - XML documents
- `.html`, `.htm` - HTML web pages

**Archives:**
- `.zip` - Compressed archives (contents are extracted)

**E-books:**
- `.epub` - Electronic book format

## How Sources Work

### Adding and Storage

When you add a source:

1. **Content Storage**: The content is securely stored in your organization's storage
2. **Content Extraction**: Text content is automatically extracted using [Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)
3. **Metadata Creation**: Source information (type, size, date added) is stored
4. **Source Record**: A source record is created with the extracted content and metadata

You can then view details, browse extracted content, download the original file, edit metadata (title, description, tags), and add comments.

## Using Sources for Test Generation

### Current Capabilities

Sources are currently used in the Knowledge section to:

- **Store Domain Knowledge**: Add content that contains domain-specific information
- **Extract Content**: Automatically extract and view text content from sources
- **Organize Information**: Categorize and tag sources for easy management

<Callout type="info">
  **Coming Soon**: Sources will be integrated with test generation to automatically create domain-specific test cases.

# Cascade Deletion and Restoration

**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Production-ready  
**Branch:** `fix/soft-deletion-behavior`

## Overview

This document describes the configuration-driven cascade system for soft deletion and restoration in the Rhesis backend. The cascade system automatically propagates soft delete and restore operations to related child entities based on a centralized configuration, eliminating the need for manual cascade logic in every CRUD function.

## Motivation

In a relational database with complex parent-child relationships, soft deleting or restoring a parent entity often requires the same operation on its children. For example:

- **Deleting a TestRun** should also soft delete all associated **TestResults**
- **Restoring a TestRun** should also restore all associated **TestResults**

### The Problem: Manual Cascade Logic

Before the cascade system, each CRUD function needed manual cascade logic:

```python
def delete_test_run(db, test_run_id, org_id, user_id):
    # Get the test run
    test_run = get_item(db, models.TestRun, test_run_id, org_id, user_id)
    
    # Manually query and soft delete all test results (50+ lines)
    query = db.query(models.TestResult).filter(
        models.TestResult.test_run_id == test_run_id
    )
    if org_id:
        query = query.filter(models.TestResult.organization_id == org_id)
    query.update({"deleted_at": datetime.utcnow()}, synchronize_session=False)
    
    # Soft delete the test run
    test_run.soft_delete()
    db.commit()
    return test_run
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Repetitive code across multiple functions
- ❌ Error-prone (easy to miss child relationships)
- ❌ Hard to maintain (adding new relationships requires code changes everywhere)
- ❌ Not scalable (every new parent-child relationship needs new manual code)

### The Solution: Configuration-Driven Cascades

With the cascade system, the same operation is now automatic:

```python
# Configuration (defined once in config/cascade_config.py)
CASCADE_RELATIONSHIPS = {
    models.TestRun: [
        CascadeRelationship(
            child_model=models.TestResult,
            foreign_key='test_run_id'
        )
    ]
}

# Implementation (automatically handles cascades)
def delete_test_run(db, test_run_id, org_id, user_id):
    return delete_item(db, models.TestRun, test_run_id, org_id, user_id)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for cascade relationships
- ✅ Automatic cascade for both delete and restore
- ✅ No code changes needed in CRUD functions
- ✅ Easy to add new cascade relationships
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all entities

## Architecture

The cascade system consists of three main components:

### 1. Cascade Configuration (`config/cascade_config.py`)

Centralized registry that defines all parent-child relationships:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Type, Dict, List
from rhesis.backend.app import models

@dataclass
class CascadeRelationship:
    """Defines a parent-child cascade relationship."""
    child_model: Type          # The child entity model
    foreign_key: str           # The FK column in child table
    cascade_delete: bool = True   # Enable cascade delete
    cascade_restore: bool = True  # Enable cascade restore
    description: str = ""      # Optional documentation

CASCADE_RELATIONSHIPS: Dict[Type, List[CascadeRelationship]] = {
    models.TestRun: [
        CascadeRelationship(
            child_model=models.TestResult,
            foreign_key='test_run_id',
            description="Test results belong to a test run"
        )
    ],
    # Add more relationships here...
}
```

### 2. Cascade Service (`services/cascade.py`)

Generic service that reads the configuration and performs bulk cascade operations:

```python
def cascade_soft_delete(
    db: Session,
    parent_model: Type,
    parent_id: UUID,
    organization_id: Optional[str] = None,
) -> int:
    """
    Cascade soft delete to all configured child relationships.
    Uses efficient bulk UPDATE queries.
    """
    total_deleted = 0
    relationships = get_cascade_relationships(parent_model)
    
    for rel in relationships:
        if not rel.cascade_delete:
            continue
        
        query = db.query(rel.child_model).filter(
            getattr(rel.child_model, rel.foreign_key) == parent_id
        )
        
        if organization_id and hasattr(rel.child_model, 'organization_id'):
            query = query.filter(rel.child_model.organization_id == organization_id)
        
        count = query.update(
            {"deleted_at": datetime.utcnow()},
            synchronize_session=False
        )
        total_deleted += count
    
    return total_deleted
```

### 3. Automatic Integration (`utils/crud_utils.py`)

The generic `delete_item()` and `restore_item()` functions automatically call the cascade service:

```python
def delete_item(
    db: Session,
    model: Type[T],
    item_id: uuid.UUID,
    organization_id: str = None,
    user_id: str = None,
) -> Optional[T]:
    """
    Soft delete an item with automatic cascade.
    """
    from rhesis.backend.app.services import cascade as cascade_service
    
    item = get_item(db, model, item_id, organization_id, user_id)
    if not item:
        return None
    
    try:
        # Automatic cascade to configured children
        cascade_service.cascade_soft_delete(db, model, item_id, organization_id)
        
        # Soft delete the parent
        item.soft_delete()
        db.commit()
        return item
    except Exception as e:
        db.rollback()
        raise
```

## How to Add New Cascade Relationships

Adding a new cascade relationship is a **5-line change** in `config/cascade_config.py`:

### Step 1: Identify the Relationship

Determine:
- **Parent model**: The entity being deleted/restored
- **Child model**: The dependent entity
- **Foreign key**: The column in the child table that references the parent

### Step 2: Add to Configuration

Add a new entry or append to an existing entry in `CASCADE_RELATIONSHIPS`:

```python
CASCADE_RELATIONSHIPS: Dict[Type, List[CascadeRelationship]] = {
    # Existing relationships
    models.TestRun: [
        CascadeRelationship(
            child_model=models.TestResult,
            foreign_key='test_run_id',
            description="Test results belong to a test run"
        )
    ],
    
    # NEW: Add cascade for Project -> TestSet
    models.Project: [
        CascadeRelationship(
            child_model=models.TestSet,
            foreign_key='project_id',
            cascade_delete=True,
            cascade_restore=True,
            description="Test sets belong to a project"
        )
    ],
    
    # NEW: Add cascade for TestSet -> Test (with multiple children)
    models.TestSet: [
        CascadeRelationship(
            child_model=models.Test,
            foreign_key='test_set_id',
            description="Tests belong to a test set"
        ),
        CascadeRelationship(
            child_model=models.TestSetMetadata,
            foreign_key='test_set_id',
            description="Metadata belongs to a test set"
        )
    ],
}
```

### Step 3: Test the Cascade

That's it! No code changes needed. The cascade will work automatically. Test it:

```python
def test_delete_project_cascades_to_test_sets(test_db, db_project, db_test_sets):
    """Verify that deleting a project cascades to test sets"""
    project_id = db_project.id
    test_set_ids = [ts.id for ts in db_test_sets]
    
    # Delete the project (cascade happens automatically)
    crud.delete_project(test_db, project_id, org_id, user_id)
    
    # Verify project is soft deleted
    assert db_project.deleted_at is not None
    
    # Verify all test sets are also soft deleted
    with without_soft_delete_filter():
        for test_set_id in test_set_ids:
            test_set = test_db.query(models.TestSet).filter(
                models.TestSet.id == test_set_id
            ).first()
            assert test_set.deleted_at is not None
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Disable Delete or Restore for Specific Relationships

You can selectively disable cascade operations:

```python
CascadeRelationship(
    child_model=models.AuditLog,
    foreign_key='entity_id',
    cascade_delete=False,    # Don't cascade delete (preserve audit trail)
    cascade_restore=False,   # Don't cascade restore (audit is immutable)
    description="Audit logs should never be deleted"
)
```

### Complex Multi-Level Cascades

The system automatically handles multi-level cascades:

```python
# Level 1: Project -> TestSet
models.Project: [
    CascadeRelationship(child_model=models.TestSet, foreign_key='project_id')
],

# Level 2: TestSet -> Test
models.TestSet: [
    CascadeRelationship(child_model=models.Test, foreign_key='test_set_id')
],

# Level 3: Test -> TestResult
models.Test: [
    CascadeRelationship(child_model=models.TestResult, foreign_key='test_id')
]
```

When you delete a `Project`:
1. All `TestSet` records are soft deleted
2. All `Test` records in those test sets are soft deleted
3. All `TestResult` records for those tests are soft deleted

**Note:** Each level is handled independently, not recursively. The parent cascade handles its immediate children only.

## Performance Considerations

### Bulk UPDATE Operations

The cascade service uses efficient bulk UPDATE queries instead of loading objects:

```python
# ✅ Efficient: Bulk UPDATE (single query)
query.update({"deleted_at": datetime.utcnow()}, synchronize_session=False)

# ❌ Inefficient: Load and update each object
for obj in query.all():
    obj.soft_delete()
```

**Benefits:**
- **Fast**: Single UPDATE query regardless of how many children
- **Memory-efficient**: No objects loaded into memory
- **Transaction-safe**: All updates happen in one transaction

### Organization Filtering

The cascade service automatically applies organization filters when available:

```python
if organization_id and hasattr(rel.child_model, 'organization_id'):
    query = query.filter(rel.child_model.organization_id == organization_id)
```

This ensures:
- **Security**: Only cascade to entities in the same organization
- **Performance**: Smaller result sets to process
- **Data integrity**: Cross-org cascades are prevented

## Transaction Management

All cascade operations are fully transactional:

```python
try:
    # Cascade to children (bulk UPDATE)
    cascade_service.cascade_soft_delete(db, model, item_id, org_id)
    
    # Soft delete parent
    item.soft_delete()
    
    # SINGLE COMMIT - atomicity guaranteed
    db.commit()
    return item
except Exception as e:
    # Rollback EVERYTHING on error
    db.rollback()
    raise
```

**Guarantees:**
- ✅ **Atomic**: Either all entities are deleted/restored, or none are
- ✅ **Consistent**: Database remains in valid state even on errors
- ✅ **Isolated**: Other transactions don't see partial cascades
- ✅ **Durable**: Committed cascades are permanent

## Testing Cascade Relationships

### Unit Tests

Test cascade relationships in isolation:

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.crud
def test_cascade_soft_delete(test_db, db_parent, db_children):
    """Test that soft deleting parent cascades to children"""
    parent_id = db_parent.id
    child_ids = [c.id for c in db_children]
    
    # Perform cascade delete
    cascade_soft_delete(test_db, models.Parent, parent_id, org_id)
    test_db.commit()
    
    # Verify all children are soft deleted
    with without_soft_delete_filter():
        for child_id in child_ids:
            child = test_db.query(models.Child).filter(
                models.Child.id == child_id
            ).first()
            assert child.deleted_at is not None
```

### Integration Tests

Test end-to-end cascade behavior:

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_delete_test_run_api_cascades(client, db_test_run, db_test_results):
    """Test that API delete endpoint properly cascades"""
    response = client.delete(f"/test-runs/{db_test_run.id}")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # Verify cascade happened
    with without_soft_delete_filter():
        for result in db_test_results:
            assert result.deleted_at is not None
```

### Test Data Factories

Use fixtures to create parent-child test data:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def db_test_run_with_results(test_db, test_organization, db_user):
    """Create a test run with associated test results"""
    test_run = models.TestRun(
        name="Test Run",
        user_id=db_user.id,
        organization_id=test_organization.id,
        # ...
    )
    test_db.add(test_run)
    test_db.flush()
    
    test_results = []
    for i in range(5):
        result = models.TestResult(
            test_run_id=test_run.id,
            organization_id=test_organization.id,
            # ...
        )
        test_db.add(result)
        test_results.append(result)
    
    test_db.commit()
    return test_run, test_results
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Document Relationships

Always add a `description` to cascade relationships:

```python
CascadeRelationship(
    child_model=models.TestResult,
    foreign_key='test_run_id',
    description="Test results belong to a test run and should cascade with it"
)
```

### 2. Consider Data Preservation

Some relationships should **NOT** cascade:

```python
# ❌ DON'T cascade delete audit logs
models.User: [
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.AuditLog,
        foreign_key='user_id',
        cascade_delete=False,  # Preserve audit trail
        description="Audit logs are immutable and should never be deleted"
    )
]

# ✅ DO cascade delete user sessions
models.User: [
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.UserSession,
        foreign_key='user_id',
        cascade_delete=True,   # Clean up sessions
        description="User sessions should be removed when user is deleted"
    )
]
```

### 3. Test Cascade Behavior

Always add tests when adding new cascade relationships:

```python
# tests/backend/crud/test_project_cascade_delete.py
def test_delete_project_cascades_to_test_sets(test_db, db_project):
    # ... test implementation ...
```

### 4. Monitor Performance

For entities with many children (>1000), monitor cascade performance:

```python
# Log cascade operations in production
logger.info(
    f"Cascade soft delete: {count} {child_model.__name__} "
    f"records for {parent_model.__name__} {parent_id}"
)
```

### 5. Keep Cascade Chains Short

Avoid deep cascade chains (>3 levels) as they can be hard to reason about:

```python
# ✅ Good: 2-level cascade
Project -> TestSet -> Test

# ⚠️ Consider carefully: 4-level cascade
Organization -> Project -> TestSet -> Test -> TestResult
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple One-to-Many

The most common pattern:

```python
models.TestRun: [
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.TestResult,
        foreign_key='test_run_id'
    )
]
```

### Pattern 2: Multiple Children

A parent with multiple child types:

```python
models.Test: [
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.TestResult,
        foreign_key='test_id'
    ),
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.TestMetric,
        foreign_key='test_id'
    ),
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.TestAttachment,
        foreign_key='test_id'
    )
]
```

### Pattern 3: Conditional Cascade

Different behavior for delete vs. restore:

```python
models.Organization: [
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.Project,
        foreign_key='organization_id',
        cascade_delete=True,   # Delete projects when org is deleted
        cascade_restore=False  # Don't auto-restore (manual review needed)
    )
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cascade Not Working

**Symptom:** Children are not being soft deleted when parent is deleted.

**Solutions:**
1. Check that the relationship is configured in `CASCADE_RELATIONSHIPS`
2. Verify the `foreign_key` name matches the actual column name
3. Ensure `cascade_delete=True` (default)
4. Check logs for any errors during cascade

### Issue: Performance Degradation

**Symptom:** Cascade operations are slow.

**Solutions:**
1. Add an index on the foreign key column
2. Verify bulk UPDATE is being used (not loading objects)
3. Check for unnecessary filters or joins
4. Consider batching for very large child sets (>10,000)

### Issue: Orphaned Records

**Symptom:** Children remain after parent is permanently deleted.

**Solutions:**
1. Soft delete cascade should happen **before** hard delete
2. Check that hard delete operations go through proper channels
3. Use database foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE` clauses as backup

## Migration Guide

### Migrating Existing Manual Cascades

If you have existing manual cascade logic, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Configuration

Add the relationship to `CASCADE_RELATIONSHIPS`:

```python
models.YourParent: [
    CascadeRelationship(
        child_model=models.YourChild,
        foreign_key='your_parent_id'
    )
]
```

#### Step 2: Remove Manual Logic

Replace manual cascade code:

```python
# BEFORE: Manual cascade (remove this)
def delete_your_parent(db, parent_id, org_id, user_id):
    parent = get_item(db, models.YourParent, parent_id, org_id, user_id)
    
    # Manual cascade logic (50+ lines) - DELETE THIS
    query = db.query(models.YourChild).filter(...)
    query.update({"deleted_at": datetime.utcnow()})
    
    parent.soft_delete()
    db.commit()
    return parent

# AFTER: Automatic cascade (use this)
def delete_your_parent(db, parent_id, org_id, user_id):
    return delete_item(db, models.YourParent, parent_id, org_id, user_id)
```

#### Step 3: Update Tests

Update tests to use the new pattern:

```python
# Update test assertions if needed
def test_delete_parent_cascades(test_db, db_parent, db_children):
    # Delete now happens automatically
    deleted = crud.delete_your_parent(test_db, parent_id, org_id, user_id)
    
    # Verify cascade with context manager
    with without_soft_delete_filter():
        for child in db_children:
            assert child.deleted_at is not None
```

## Summary

The cascade system provides a **scalable, maintainable, and efficient** way to handle parent-child relationships in soft deletion and restoration:

- **Configuration-driven**: 5 lines to add new relationships
- **Automatic**: No code changes in CRUD functions
- **Efficient**: Bulk UPDATE operations
- **Transaction-safe**: Full ACID guarantees
- **Testable**: Clear patterns for unit and integration tests

When adding new cascade relationships, simply update `config/cascade_config.py` and add tests. The system handles the rest automatically.

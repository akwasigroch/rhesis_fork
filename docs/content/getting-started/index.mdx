## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

<Callout type="default">
  **System Requirements** - **Python 3.8+** with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager -
  **Node.js 18+** and npm - **Git** for version control - **Docker** (optional, for containerized

</CodeBlock>

### Access Your Application

Once everything is running, you can access:

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Documentation**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Project Architecture

Rhesis is organized as a monorepo containing multiple applications and packages:

{/* Architecture components */}
<ArchitectureOverview />

## Development Workflow

### Using the CLI Tool

Our CLI tool makes it easy to manage all services:

<CodeBlock
  filename="Terminal"
  language="bash"
  isTerminal={true}
>
{`# Start all services
./rh backend start
./rh frontend start
./rh docs start

# Get help
./rh help`}
</CodeBlock>

### Manual Development

If you prefer to run services individually:

<CodeBlock
  filename="Terminal"
  language="bash"
  isTerminal={true}
>
{`# Backend (FastAPI)
cd apps/backend
uv run uvicorn rhesis.backend.app.main:app --reload --port 8080

# Frontend (React)
cd apps/frontend
npm run dev

# Documentation (Nextra)
cd apps/documentation
npm run dev`}
</CodeBlock>

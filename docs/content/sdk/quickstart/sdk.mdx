# Python SDK

The Rhesis SDK enables developers to create and manage test sets for their Gen AI applications. It also provides the functionality to manage tests on our platform.

## Installation

```bash
pip install rhesis-sdk
```

## Getting Started

The SDK can be used standalone or integrated with our platform. To communicate with our platform and to use LLMs provided by us you need to obtain an API key.

<Steps>
### Obtain an API key

1. Visit [Rhesis App](https://app.rhesis.ai)
2. Sign up for a Rhesis account
3. Navigate to your account settings
4. Generate a new API key

Your API key will be in the format `rh-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
Keep this key secure and never share it publicly.

### Configure the SDK

You can configure the SDK either through environment variables or direct configuration:

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
export RHESIS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export RHESIS_BASE_URL="https://api.rhesis.ai"
```

**Direct Configuration:**

```python
import rhesis

rhesis.api_key = "your-api-key"
rhesis.base_url = "https://api.rhesis.ai"  # optional
```

### Basic Usage

Once configured, you can start using the SDK to create and manage tests:

```python
from rhesis.sdk import RhesisClient

# Initialize the client
client = RhesisClient()

# Create a test
test = client.create_test(
    prompt="What is the capital of France?",
    expected_response="Paris",
    behavior="Accuracy"
)

# Run the test
result = client.run_test(test_id=test.id, endpoint_id="your-endpoint-id")
print(result)
```

</Steps>

## Models

Models are core components of the SDK that enable you to create and manage test sets for Gen AI applications. Models also play a crucial role in the evaluation process, serving as LLM judges to assess and validate outputs.

### Using the `get_model` function

The easiest way to use models is through the `get_model` function. When called without any arguments, this function returns the default Rhesis model.

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

model = get_model()
```

To use a different provider, you can pass the provider name as an argument. This will use the default model for that provider.

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

# Use default Gemini model
model = get_model("gemini")
```

**Supported providers:**

- `gemini` - Google's AI models with multimodal support
- `openai` - OpenAI models including GPT-4
- `huggingface` - Open-source models from Hugging Face
- `ollama` - Local model execution using Ollama
- `rhesis` - Models served by Rhesis

To use a specific model, provide its name in the format `provider/model_name`:

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

model = get_model("gemini/gemini-2.0-flash")
```

The above code is equivalent to:

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

model = get_model(provider="gemini", model_name="gemini-2.0-flash")
```

### Direct import

Alternatively, you can access models by importing the model class directly. When you provide a model name as an argument, that specific model will be used. If no model name is provided, the default model for that provider will be used.

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import GeminiLLM, OllamaLLM

# Use default Ollama model
ollama_model = OllamaLLM()

# Use specific Gemini model
gemini_model = GeminiLLM('gemini-2.0-flash')
```

### Generate content with models

All models share a consistent interface. The primary function is `generate`, which accepts:

- `prompt`: The text prompt for generation
- `schema`: (optional) A Pydantic schema defining the structure of the generated text

**Generate text using prompt only:**

```python
# Use default Rhesis model
model = get_model()
output = model.generate(prompt="What is the capital of France?")
# Output: "The capital of France is Paris."
```

**Generate structured output using schemas:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

class City(BaseModel):
    name: str
    population: int

class CityResponse(BaseModel):
    biggest_cities: list[City]

# Use default Rhesis model
model = get_model()
output = model.generate(
    prompt="The list of 5 biggest cities in Germany?",
    schema=CityResponse
)
```

### Using models with synthesizers and metrics

Models become most useful when combined with synthesizers and metrics:

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model
from rhesis.sdk.synthesizers import PromptSynthesizer
from rhesis.sdk.metrics import RhesisPromptMetricNumeric

# With synthesizers
model = get_model("gemini")
synthesizer = PromptSynthesizer(
    prompt="Generate tests for the car selling chatbot",
    model=model
)

# With metrics
metric = RhesisPromptMetricNumeric(
    name="answer_quality_evaluator",
    evaluation_prompt="Evaluate the answer for accuracy, completeness, clarity, and relevance.",
    model="gemini"
)
```
